Gofr
==========

*Gofr* (pronounced "gopher") is a Feed Reader (Google Reader clone) for [Google App Engine] [1]. It grew out of my frustration with [grr's] [2] relational database backend, and my inability to optimize it beyond (still) unsatisfactory results. 

_Gofr_ is written in [Go] [3], and uses the [Google Cloud Datastore] [4]. Like _grr_, it relies heavily on [JavaScript] [5].
