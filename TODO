Localization
Use a mutex to prevent simultaneous feed updates

Split the following tasks, so that some of the work is done immediately,
while the rest is done in a background task:

  Mark All as Read
    Request: Reset unread counts for each subscription
    Task: Set properties to 'read'
    Client: just mark all in scope as 'read' without refreshing

Broken due to encoding: http://www.qwantz.com/index.php
Shift+N/P: always skips only to unread subs
Continue: broken for second page(?)
