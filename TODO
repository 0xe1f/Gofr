Localization
Use a mutex to prevent simultaneous feed updates

"Subscribe" is inefficient in the way it performs lookups
of potentially existing feeds

Split the following tasks, so that some of the work is done immediately,
while the rest is done in a background task:

  Mark All as Read
    Request: Reset unread counts for each subscription
    Task: Set properties to 'read'
    Client: just mark all in scope as 'read' without refreshing

Production: Cache-control seems to be ignored for favicons(?)
